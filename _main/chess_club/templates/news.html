            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GM Nihal Sarin and GM Nana Dzagnidze are in the sole leads of their respective groups with an
                identical 4.5 points from six games in the 2022 Tata Steel Chess India Open Rapid and 2022 Tata Steel
                Chess India Women's Rapid. Overnight leader GM Shakhriyar Mamedyarov had a tough day with two losses and
                a draw, but joined GM Arjun Erigaisi to follow the leader on 3.5 points, giving Nihal a full-point lead
                going into the final day of the rapid tomorrow. In the women's section, Dzagnidze is trailed by GM Humpy
                Koneru, GM Mariya

            </div>
                Muzychuk GM Anna Ushenina, and IM Vaishali Rameshbabu, all just half a point behind.
                After scoring two and a half points out of three games on the second day and capturing the sole lead,
                Nihal appeared on the live commentary and was asked which was his favorite among the wins against
                GM Gukesh D and GM S P Sethuraman. He replied with characteristic modesty, "I didn't play very well in
                either of the games, but probably the first one (against Gukesh) was sounder," prompting GM Viswanathan
                Anand to quip with a chuckle: "He didn't play very well in either of the gamesâ€”what do you do with him?!
                "</p>

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a day of resurgence for GM Hikaru Nakamura, who scored two wins and a draw, and his win in
                the very first game of the day against the former leader Mamedyarov earned very high praise from Anand.
                Anand assessed 28.e5 as the pivotal moment of the game and remarked: "Full marks to Hikaru. Almost
                trademark Hikaru: ... Some quiet position he plays. And he converts efficiently. After e5 he managed
                the position just brilliantly. Improved the position with the same pace as Shakhriyar and never let him
                back into the game."</p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the day's play, when Anand quizzed Nakamura about his path to a comeback after
                a difficult first day in the tournament, the American grandmaster came up with a jaw-dropping
                revelation: "After the game yesterday, I fell asleep at eight, ... woke up at ... 2.40
                and Titled Tuesday began at 3.00 and I decided to play this! ... I continued my very poor form
                for a couple of games and I played myself into a good form ... And then I just played blitz for about
                seven hours ... I went to sleep at 11 and slept till the round. So, ... interesting 24 hours!
